This is one the very few papers I really enjoy reading in terms of flow, name and easy to run code. 


[REFORMER The efficient Transformer]()


# Graph Neural Networks Study Group

I was lucky enough to join a study group sharing about graph neural networks




[Graph classification - Part 1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FItqLQMiQgiU2rpdgJtOmNcUsJYrwSYz3E568uZBPFU/edit?usp=sharing)
