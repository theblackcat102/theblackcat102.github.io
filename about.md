### Fun facts

1. Currently master student at National Chiao Tung University 

    * Focus in NLP, data mining and GANs (generative adversarial networks)

2. Current side-projects

    * [Unisearch](https://unisearch.cc/) : A vector based search engine demo. Underlying neural network is based on [CLIP](https://openai.com/blog/clip/) , but trained on title-content and text-image pair datasets. The text encoder also supports 9 different languages ( english, chinese, spanish, italian, japanese, korean, vietnamese, german, french ). Image search works pretty good, but some finetuning required to work better in text search.

    * [Today Headlines](https://todayheadlines.live/) news aggregation website using an experimental graph clustering in 5 different regions (US, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia).The aim is to optimize for speed, no statistic-based nor neural network models required.

3. Active maintainers of these pypi packages:

    * [fastlangid](https://pypi.org/project/fastlangid/) : The only language detection library that supports simplified chinese, traditional chinese and cantonese 

    * [h5record](https://pypi.org/project/h5record/) : Easy to use large scale dataset format for pytorch

4. Multilinguist : I speak in 4 different languages (English, Chinese, Cantonese, Malay)

5. Published work:

    * [Character-Preserving Coherent Story Visualization](https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2020/papers_ECCV/papers/123620018.pdf) : generate clear and coherent characters between images of the same story. Accepted by ECCV 2020
